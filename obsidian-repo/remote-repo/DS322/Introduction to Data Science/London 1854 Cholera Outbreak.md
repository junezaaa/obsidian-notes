**Example of how we use data to verify hypothesis and solve problem

	In 1854 there was a doctor named John Snow who solved the problem about a Cholera outbreak in London that resulted in 616 deaths total, in which 127 of the 616 deaths total are near Broad Street in 3 days.

In that time, people believed that Cholera was cause by miasma, but John had a [[Domain Knowledge]] about Cholera, and he believed that they were transmitted by water.

Using said knowledge. John Snow solved this problem, based on the data of deaths. Using the street map to plot the water pumps. The map showed that most deaths are near the water pump on Broad Street. In which he have a **hypothesis** that the Broad Street's water pump is the cause of the outbreak.

Even though the London officials didn't believed his hypothesis, they took action anyways **based on the data analysis** , in which after that, the outbreak died down.
